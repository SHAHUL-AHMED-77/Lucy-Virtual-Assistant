Lucy is a voice-activated virtual assistant designed to perform a variety of tasks like fetching the latest news, telling jokes, giving weather updates, and more. This project leverages [Python](https://www.python.org/) and several libraries to create an interactive, speech-based assistant.

## Features

- **Voice-activated commands**: Lucy listens for your commands and responds with the appropriate actions.
- **Fun facts & Motivational quotes**: Get random fun facts and motivational quotes to brighten your day.
- **Anime Recommendations**: Receive anime suggestions when you're unsure of what to watch next.
- **News Updates**: Stay updated with the latest news headlines.
- **Jokes**: Need a laugh? Ask Lucy to tell you a joke.
- **Weather Reports**: Get real-time weather updates for any city.
- **Music Playback**: Play your favorite songs by specifying the title.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Internet connection (for fetching news, weather, and other data)

### Libraries Required
Install the required libraries using `pip`:

```

### Setup

- **To get the weather**: `"What's the weather in New York?"`
- **To get news**: `"Give me the latest news"`
